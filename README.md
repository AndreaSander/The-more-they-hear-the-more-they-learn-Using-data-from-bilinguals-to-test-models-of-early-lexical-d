# The_more_they_hear_the_more_they_learn?
 load, merge, analyses and visualization scripts for the 2022 bilingual word comprehension study entitled: The more they hear the more they learn? Using data from bilinguals to test models of early word learning and comprehension.
To replicate the findings from the study, the Rscripts should be run in order starting by #1. However the scripts are all set up to be run individually if desired. 
This repository contains anonymized data from Looking-While-Listening studies performed on bilingual children in Montreal Canada, as well as anonymized demographic data from the same children. When the data is made public it will be so under an MIT license. The merged data folder contains the cleaned and merged data resulting from running the load and merge R script. The supplementary tables folder contains result tables resulting from running the other exploratory analyses script.
